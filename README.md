# FOC-Driver
A modified version of the SimpleFOC based project. The official design was a bit large for my project below, so I redesigned the FOC drive and made it small enough (42mm x 42mm) to fit a small BLDC motor as well as 42 step motor.


## FOC-Driver v1.0
The 1.0 version is just a testing version. Progress has been slow due to a number of constraints, including funding and logistics. Because it is a testing version, I add a small OLED screen to display the current state. 

2D PCB looks like:

### urrent Progress:
Part of the soldering has been completed. Some components still missing.
