# FOC-Driver
"The 'FOC Driver Comet' is a DIY project I've worked on to offer both hobbyists and tech tinkerers a hands-on, scalable tool for managing brushless DC (BLDC) motors through the user-friendly SimpleFOC library. I plan to integrate this driver into my personal projects, including the 'robot arm, venus'. Looking ahead, I also plan to incorporate it into a robot dog I'm dreaming up. This project isn't just about building something functionalâ€”it's about fueling creativity and innovation in robotics at a grassroots level, encouraging others to experiment and evolve their own ideas into something tangible and thrilling."

## FOC-Driver v1.0
The 1.0 version is just a testing version. Progress has been slow due to a number of constraints, including funding and logistics. Because it is a testing version, I add a small OLED screen to display the current state.

But the design of the circuit has some bugs that the inductor has burned. 

## FOC-Driver v1.1

New PCB design (3D version):

Now add a new convert circuit to insulate the different power supply source.
